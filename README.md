# Learning Projects

This repository is where I document my programming learning. I'm a career switcher working toward a software development position, and this serves as proof of work for that goal.

## What This Is

A collection of projects I build while learning to program. The code here represents where I am at any given point, not polished portfolio pieces. Some projects are rough, some are cleaner.

Everything here is to show what things I built, and for me to learn from the process (how Git/GitHub works and programming).

I'm self-taught, learning independently through free resources, books, and building things. I don't have a CS education, and I am not using courses. Everything here comes from figuring things out on my own, making mistakes, and fixing them.

## Why I'm Doing This

There are two reasons I'm putting this together.

The first is practical: I want something concrete to show potential employers. A repository with actual code is more useful than saying "I'm learning to program" with nothing to back it up. This is the backing.

The second is personal: I want to be capable of making things by myself. Games, apps, tools, whatever I end up building. The end goal is working in the programming field somewhere. I haven't picked a specific niche yet because I don't know enough to make that choice well. For now I'm building general capability and seeing what direction makes sense as I learn more.

Game development is a direction I'm interested in, but it's not the only one. I'm keeping options open while focusing on fundamentals.

## What's In Here

The repository is organized by language and technology. The subfolders are named to be self-explanatory, and each one has its own README with specifics about what's inside.

As I learn new things and work on new projects, more folders might appear. The structure will grow with what I'm doing.

## Reflection Documents

Inside project folders, there are reflection documents.

These are where I write about: what I was trying to do; problems I ran into; how I solved them; what I learned along the way. They're not polished write-ups or tutorials. They're my thinking while working through the code which can be sometimes messy, sometimes repetitive, but shows some of the process I went through. The purpose is to document what's happening while I'm learning, not to present a clean narrative after the fact, **keep this information in mind when opening any of them**.

If someone wants to see how I approach problems and how I think through things when I'm stuck, the reflection documents show some level of that.

## Future

I don't have a fixed expansion plan. Projects get added based on what I'm learning and what catches my interest at the time. Some things might sit untouched for a while, then get picked back up. The pace depends on what else is going on in my life.

The structure might change as this grows. If it does, I'll update things to make sense of whatever the repository becomes.
